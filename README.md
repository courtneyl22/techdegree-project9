# Full Stack JavaScript Techdegree v2 - REST API Project

This is the back end portion of the app getting created. Here's what I've done:

Database Connection
- Sequelize is listed as a dependency in the package.json file
- Sequelize is configured to use the fsjstd-restapi.db SQLite database that's generated by the npm run seed command
- A message is written to the console when thereâ€™s an error connecting to the database
- A message is written to the console when the database connection is successfully opened

User Model
- The user schema follows the provided specification:
  1. id (Integer, primary key, auto-generated)
  2. firstName (String)
  3. lastName (String)
  4. emailAddress (String)
  5. password (String)
  
Course Model
- The course schema follows the provided specification:
  1. id (Integer, primary key, auto-generated)
  2. userId (id from the Users table)
  3. title (String)
  4. description (Text)
  5. estimatedTime (String, nullable)
  6. materialsNeeded (String, nullable

Model Associations
- A HasMany association is defined between the User and Course models
- A BelongsTo association is defined between the Course and User models

User Routes
- All of the following user routes are available and return the following data as specified:
  1. GET /api/users 200 - Returns the currently authenticated user
  2. POST /api/users 201 - Creates a user, sets the Location header to "/", and returns no content

Course Routes
- All of the following course routes are available and return the following data as specified:
  1. GET /api/courses 200 - Returns a list of courses (including the user that owns each course)
  2. GET /api/courses/:id 200 - Returns a the course (including the user that owns the course) for the provided course ID
  3. POST /api/courses 201 - Creates a course, sets the Location header to the URI for the course, and returns no content
  4. PUT /api/courses/:id 204 - Updates a course and returns no content
  5. DELETE /api/courses/:id 204 - Deletes a course and returns no content

Validations
- The POST and PUT routes validate if the request body contains the following required values:
  1. User:
    a. firstName
    b. lastName
    c. emailAddress
    d. password
  2. Course:
    a.title
    b. description
- Validation error(s) are sent with a400 status code

Password Security
- The POST /api/users route hashes the user's password before persisting the user to the database

Permissions
- An Express middleware function authenticates the following routes:
  1. GET /api/users
  2. POST /api/courses
  3. PUT /api/courses/:id
  4. DELETE /api/courses/:id
- When authentication fails a 401 status code is returned
